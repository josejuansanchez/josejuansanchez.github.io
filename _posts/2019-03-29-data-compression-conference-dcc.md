The [Data Compression Conference (DCC)][1] is an international forum for current work on data compression and related applications.
In 2019, [DCC][1] has taken place from 26 to 29 March and has been hosted at the [The Cliff Lodge][2] convention center in the beautiful Snowbird & Alta Ski areas, UTAH, USA.

Our manuscript, *Client-Driven Transmission of JPEG2000 Image Sequences Using Motion Compensated Conditional Replenishment*, has been accepted as a poster and has been presented at the [DCC poster session][3].

The poster is available [here]({{ site.url }}/resources/2019-03-29/poster/poster.pdf).
