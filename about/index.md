## About me

<p align="center">

</p>

I currently work as a Secondary School Teacher at [IES Celia Viñas (Almería)][0],
where I teach Computer Science in a vocational education course.

I received an MSc degree in Computer Science in 2008 and a PhD in Computer
Science from the [University of Almería][1] in 2024. Previously, I was a member
of the [Supercomputing-Algorithms Research Group][2] at the [University of
Almería][3], where I worked in the area of image coding and transmission.

In my spare time I enjoy designing and developing native mobile apps for
[Android][4], experimenting and making stuff with [Arduino][5] and [Raspberry
Pi][6], and learning new things.

I have collaborated with [Packt Publishing](https://www.packtpub.com) as a book
reviewer of [Android Sensor Programming By
Example](https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/android-sensor-programming-example)
(2016).

I was a co-founder of *Android Almería Developers Group* and an active member
of [HackLab Almería][8], where I collaborated in organizing programming talks,
[Hackathons][9] and [Game Jams][13].

I am proud to have collaborated in the development of open source projects like
[NanoPlayBoard][15]. Moreover, I have participated as a mentor in [Google Summer
of Code 2015][11] and [GSOC 2016][14] with the [P2PSP][12] organization.
