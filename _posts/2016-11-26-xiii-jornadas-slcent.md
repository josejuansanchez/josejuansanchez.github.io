This year we have been invited to take part in the **[XIII Jornadas SLCENT][1]**, organised by [IES Al-Ándalus][2], [CEP Almería][3] and [HackLab Almería][4].

This was the first time that **NanoPlayBoard** has been presented in public and it was very exciting to share the project with students, teachers and the rest of the educational community.

[Antonio Morales][5] explained how has been the creation process of the board from the hardware overview and [José Juan Sánchez][6] showed different software resources that have been developed for the project in order to make easy the use of the board.

The slides used in the talks are available below.

A big thanks to the organization of the event. We had a really great time there!
